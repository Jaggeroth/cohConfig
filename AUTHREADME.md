# Jagged's i24 Build log - Auth Server Step
These instructions are the steps I took to get a local Auth Server up and running. To use these you should already have a working local server as described in the README.md

# Install Steps
1. Change server.cfg to use AuthServer by changing the lines from
   ```
   UseFakeAuth 1
   #AuthServer 127.0.0.1
   ```
   to
   ```
   #UseFakeAuth 1
   AuthServer 127.0.0.1 2104
   ```
2. Create a config file for the AuthServer. 
   Confusingly this does not live in the same place as the other configs and follows a different naming convention.
   Copy the "\bin\etc\config.txt" file from this repo to your server directory i.e. "C:\coh\bin\etc\config.txt
3. Create a server entry in the auth database:
   ```
   INSERT INTO cohauth.dbo.server (id, name, ip, inner_ip, ageLimit, pk_flag, server_group_id) VALUES(1, 'Paragon', '127.0.0.1', '127.0.0.1', 0, 0, 1);
   INSERT INTO cohauth.dbo.worldstatus (idx, status) VALUES (1, 1);
   ```
   I don't believe the server name is used.
4. Create an account record for yourself.
   The account password needs to be hashed, but fortunately the work for this has been done for us.
   See URL: http://cohstuff.dreamhosters.com/makeaccount.php
   Enter a unique ID number for your user (such as "1")
   Enter a name and a password. Be sure to make sure your password is the right length as the page does not check.
   This will generate SQL to load the account into your database. Such as:
   ```
   INSERT INTO cohauth.dbo.user_account (account, uid, forum_id, pay_stat) VALUES ('test', 1, 1, 1014);
   INSERT INTO cohauth.dbo.user_auth (account, password, salt, hash_type) VALUES ('test', CONVERT(BINARY(128),'46ffce3efcfe83bfa205b076d7c2084b9dcf04cdb26f9019103cde29779d26a85216b2c0f43ba1a8fb9b7fa22f05a949bf4edc314af27629e8fc23014e77a24d'), 0, 1);
   INSERT INTO cohauth.dbo.user_data (uid, user_data) VALUES (1, 0x0080C2E000D00B0C000000000CB40058);
   INSERT INTO cohauth.dbo.user_server_group (uid, server_group_id) VALUES (1, 1);
   ```
   If you have been using your server by logging directly into the server, you may have created characters that are assigned to a user id. If you want those characters to be associated with your new account you should:
   1. Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
   2. Navigate to the "cohdb" database.
   3. Expand the tables and select the "Ents" table.
   4. Right click and select the top 1000 entries.
   5. Find a character you want to associate with the new user and find the AuthId from that row.
   6. Enter that AuthId as the unique ID.
   7. Enter name and password and generate the sql.
5. Open a new query window on the "cohAuth" database, enter and execute the SQL generated by the form above.
6. From the "C:\coh\bin" start the AuthServer.exe
7. Lauch the other applications as before:
   chatserver.exe -noreserved 
   launcher.exe
   dbserver.exe
8. Launch the City of Heroes application as before but using the following launch parameters:
   ```
   CityOfHeroes.exe -auth 127.0.0.1 -console -project "coh"
   ```
   You should be able to sign in with your new password.
   
# Account Server
1. It doesn't make sense to run the AuthServer without the Account Server. So copy the new Account_server.cfg from the repo to  "C:\coh\bin\data\server\db\account_server.cfg"
   Remember to update the config with the address and password for your database instance:
   ```
   SqlLogin "DRIVER={SQL Server Native Client 11.0};Server=YOURPC\COH;Uid=sa;Pwd=yoursapassword;"
   ```
2. Do some SQL inserts to set up the account details?
3. Lauch the applications again, this time including the Account Server:
   AuthServer.exe
   AccountServer.exe
   chatserver.exe -noreserved 
   launcher.exe
   dbserver.exe
4. Launch the City of Heroes application as before but using the following launch parameters:
   ```
   CityOfHeroes.exe -auth 127.0.0.1 -console -project "coh"
   ```
