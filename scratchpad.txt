@everyone this is supposedly all we were missing from i25, the last source we were missing. it's i25 but still it's worth archiving. if it 404s just try again until it lets you in. https://anonymousfiles.io/svrZ9sD0/

auth:Senpai



go into your authserver solution
serversocketex.cpp line 631
change Send to NonEncSend
recompile and try again

- Have AccountServer setup and running
- Log in to an account, once you select the shard and arrive on the character selection screen, the DB should have a new row for the account and some default SKU granted to this account
- Log out from the game
- Stop AccountServer, modify the account table to give 46 loyalty points (enough to buy one of each rewards) and add more SKU to the `inventory` table for the account (`auth_id`) that you want to grant them to
- Restart AccountServer to read the changed tables
- Log in, check if you got the loyalty points and new SKU

if you want to fill in your inventory table you can use this:
USE cohacc;

INSERT INTO inventory(
    auth_id,
    sku_id,
    granted_total
) SELECT
    'place auth_id here',
    sku_id,
    1
 FROM product;

 A common bind for Teleport is 
 /bind LSHIFT+LBUTTON "pow_exec_name Teleport"
 This combines activating the power and placing the reticule into a single step, activated by shift-left-clicking a location.
 
 /bind lshift+lbutton powexec_name Teleport
